A document scanner application that converts images of rectangular documents into a top-down view, tested within a simulated environment using the Webots robotics simulator and OpenCV for image processing. The simulation setup includes a conveyor belt, cardboard box models, a downward-facing camera, and light sources, highlighting key variables such as HSV threshold values, lighting conditions, box sizes, document sizes and 3D model textures, which influence the accuracy and reliability of the document scanner.
