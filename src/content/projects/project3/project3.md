A practical application of computer vision to improve TV remote usability for older adults. Using Deep learning for object detection, the solution provides feedback on the current state of a TV. The model was tested using an edge device, the JeVois-A33 smart machine camera, which runs a fine-tuned YOLOv8 ONNX model to detect and interpret one TV interface in a controlled environment, aiming to provide a more intuitive and accessible user experience.
